Welcome to your GitHub repository for the Annotated Bibliography Chatbot! This project aims to build a chatbot that can assist university freshmen with academic writing, particularly with their first assignment, an annotated bibliography.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In order to try this Chatbot, please create rename the env.js.example file to env.js and input your api keys.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

We've already run this for you in the `Codespaces: server` terminal window below. If you need to stop the server for any reason you can just run `npm start` again to bring it back online.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the built-in Simple Browser (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P > Simple Browser: Show`) to view your running application.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
